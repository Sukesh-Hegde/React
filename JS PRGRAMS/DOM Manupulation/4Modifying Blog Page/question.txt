Problem statement
For the Blog Page, we built in the previous topic and modified it to add move up, move down, and delete functionality using an event listener.

Objective:

The dom structure of the project is as shown in the figure:

For your convenience, the post part has already been added. Your task is to add event listeners to the buttons.

For that:-

1. Creates a new div element with the class "blog-buttons".
2. Create a new button element with the class "blog-button" and "move-up" and append it to the "blog-buttons" div.
3. Create a new button element with the class "blog-button" and "move-down" and append it to the "blog-buttons" div.
4. Create a new button element with the class "blog-button" and "delete" and append it to the "blog-buttons" div.
5. Append the "blog-buttons" to "newbox" element
6. Add event listener to the "move-up", "move-down" and "delete" button
7. The move-up button should be able to move the blog item one step up in the "bloglist".
8. The move-down button should be able to move the blog item one step down in the "bloglist".
9. The delete button should be able to delete that particular blog from the dom element.

Expected Output:

Hint:
Use the onClick event to add the event listener.
Use insertBefore to append at a specific position.
